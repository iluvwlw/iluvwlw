## WSG YALL
Trying to get used to this thing cuz I genuinely don't know how to use it, but I'm definitely gonna drop some stuff about me and eventually customize it properly. ***(SO YES, This is a WIP)***

For starters, this is a *Pony Town* profile.. OKAY? I'M STILL STUDYING, MICHAEL. I DON'T KNOW PROGRAMMING.

## so uh.. ANYWAY

-I'm a girlll but i genuinely don't care if you want to use any other pronouns, like- i don't care at all.. Like, my pronouns are there, if you want to use them, cool, if you don't.. also cool lol

-If you want to get to know me better and you see me around, don't be shy! Just talk to me, I'm a nice gal :) (Though, don't try to boop me a thousand times just to get my attention if.. I'm obviously AFK, alright? I've seen y'all. *I'm not going to POINT FINGERS at ANYONE.*

-I'M A MINOR. I'm currently 17 years old.. yet. I'm turning 18 in 6 months.. and no, I'm not feeling great about it. Just a heads up, don't talk to me if you're way too damn older than me or way too damn younger than me, okay? Nothing personal, just scared of potential ~creeps~ out there that pretend to be an age they obviously aren't smh

So, I think that's probably it.

Other info about me that are probably irrelevant is that I'm a girl kisser and probably demiromantic :) (I'm still discovering myself, ok?????)

and so uhhh,, eehhhh- iiiii mmmm
